    <p>Michael please either write the postman for user functions yourself or msg me when the rest is done!</p>

    <h3>How to use:</h3>
    <p>first go to: <a href="#/view1" target="_blank">Home!</a><br>
        then you can either login with one of the following:<br>
        Username: user, Password: test, Role:User<br>
        Username: admin, Password: test, Role:Admin<br>
        Username: user_admin, Password: test, Role:User and Admin<br>
        or you can create your own user by clicking on the sign-up link in the right corner,<br>
        this user will however only have the user role!
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are logged in as a user, you should see two new tabs in the navbar!, "Company Info" and "Exchange Rate Info"<br>
    </p>
    <p>Firstly you can lookup any company in Denmark and Norway on the Company Info page, by typing in the Name or CVR of the company and pushing the search button.<br>
        Remember to chose the right country in the drop down to the left of the search field!</p>
    <p>You can also try the Exchange Rate function where you can convert from all the currencies registered in the Danish National Bank to Danish Kroner.
        This can be done by simply typing the amount you want to convert, and choosing the currency you want to convert from in the dropdown menu.
        Furthermore you can see the the current exchange rates just below the conversion function, this can be updated by clicking the "update" button in the top left of the page. </p>

    <p>
        When you are logged in as a admin, you should see a new tab called "All Users".<br>
        When you enter this new tab, you will be presented with a table that shows all the users currently in the database as well as the option to delete this!<br>
        obs! you will not be able to delete the 3 standard users: "user", "admin" and "user_admin"!
    </p>
